# Python code for the February 2017 digitalk

These are two code snippets that can be used to generate a
* Nightingale´s Rose style wedge diagram
* a document revision history inspired by HistoryFlow from IBM Research https://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/ 

The documentation will need some updates regarding the data formats to be used, the code implies certain data layouts and folder structures.

Note, that I copied the .py source code file to *.txt fiels to avoid content blocking.
